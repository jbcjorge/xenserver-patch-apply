# Xenserver updater

This script is meant to update xenserver (the free edition) easily.

The development path is to do this task in a complete automatic fashion, downloading the needed updates, move the machines between hosts and apply the patches wth needed reboots also.

For now, it's only applying the patches in "batch" mode after those being downloaded by hand and placed in a specific route.
